# SMA-Backtest

This is a simple backtesting library where you can test and optimize different moving averages to maximize returns.

Upon cloning the repository, do what you need to do and create a virtual environment then run: 

~~~pip install -r requirements.txt~~~

in your terminal.

From here, you can look at test.ipynb as it'll illustrate how to use the library to visualize and optimize a simple moving average tradig strategy.
